### Installation
1: Download `Autosave-Install.bat` from the latest release and run the program
<br>
2: Enter the path where your files are stored and where you want to back them up to when prompted
<br>
3: After the installer is complete, restart your system to enable backup, and test to see if it is working
<br>
<br>
If the installer fails using normal permissions, try to run it as an administrator. If it still fails, report it as an [issue](https://github.com/Chordavei/Autosave/issues)
<br>
To uninstall Autosave, go to Settings > Apps > Installed Apps and search for `Autosave v1.0`

### Changing Directories
To change the main or backup directory, uninstall Autosave and reinstall it with the new path(s). If you do are comfortable with editing the file, you can edit the `Autosave-System.bat` file in your LocalAppData\Autosave folder

### Stopping Autosave
You can stop Autosave by opening Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), searching for `cmd.exe`, and terminating the job. If you have other command prompts open, make sure to close them or identify the correct task for Autosave before termination. You can also disable Autosave on startup by going to Settings > Apps > Startup

### Safety
If you have any doubts about how Autosave functions, you can read the installation file, which outlines the code for everything that Autosave uses with comments. If you have any other concerns, you may report it as an [issue](https://github.com/Chordavei/Autosave/issues)
